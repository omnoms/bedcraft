# bedcraft
A repository of Minecraft Bedrock Edition farms converted into structura files.

Lets start with registering an "Issue" where the Title is the name of the farm, A description containing the general gist of it or desired outcome of it, and if known the size of the farm and if it needs to be isolated from other farms (mob farms and similar) so that we can plan out how to space them out in the world download later on.

If you feel you can take on one of the farms requested/listed in the issues, please assign yourself it, fork the repo, add an appropriate named folder, commit/upload your structura file, make a PR to this with the issue tagged in the PR.
